# Quest System

This is a sample project that shows one way of building a Quest System in Unity.

The branches in this repo follow the implementation for the video series. Each branch represents the state of the system for a given video. The videos can be found on my YouTube channel.

Please feel free to take the system from this example and use it however you'd like!
